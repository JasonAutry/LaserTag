# Laser Tag

This was most of my part of a laser tag application that I created as part of a group. The app allowed you to join teams and then view the real world location of your teammates on a live updating map and wirelessly connect your phone to a laser gun. My responability was to create the game UI, manage data transfer between the phone and Firebase Database, and perform most of the game logic. I used a tool called Mapbox that allowed me to place markers on a real world map based on the user's phone's GPS data. Many parts of the project can not be uploaded to github due to size restrictions but these are the files I produced for the project. This was the first time using Unity and C# for my whole team and I.
The code is very messy as I was having troubles getting the various components to work together and I never had a chance to go back and clean it up.
